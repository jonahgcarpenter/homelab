# Homelab

Welcome to the official documentation for my personal homelab! This repository serves as a central knowledge base for the setup and what I do in my free time.

My lab currently consists of **three physical host machines running Proxmox VE**, which in turn host a **K3s Kubernetes cluster**. This setup allows for experimentation with virtualization, containerization, networking, and various self-hosted applications.

## tujuan (Purpose of this Homelab)

This homelab serves several purposes:

- **Learning & Experimentation:** A sandbox to explore new technologies, software, and configurations in a controlled environment. This includes virtualization (Proxmox), containerization (Docker, K3s), networking, and various server applications.
- **Self-Hosting:** Running various services for personal use, such as media servers, home automation, development tools, and personal cloud storage.
- **Skill Development:** Enhancing skills in system administration, network management, DevOps practices, and cybersecurity.
